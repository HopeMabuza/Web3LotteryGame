# Web3 Lottery Game (Smart Contract)

## Project Overview

This project is a **decentralised lottery game** implemented as an Ethereum smart contract using **Solidity**. The goal is to simulate a fair lottery where players choose a sequence of numbers, and winnings are distributed based on how many numbers match the winning sequence **in the correct order**.

The contract is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates core Web3 concepts such as:

* Smart contracts
* Ether pooling and distribution
* On-chain game logic
* State management between lottery rounds

---

## Lottery Rules

* Each ticket consists of **7 numbers**
* Valid numbers range from **1 to 47**
* Winning numbers are **randomly generated by the contract**
* Numbers must match the **exact sequence** to count as a win

### Prize Distribution

The total prize pool is distributed as follows:

| Correct Numbers | Reward Percentage |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| 1               | 0%                |
| 2               | 5%                |
| 3               | 10%               |
| 4               | 15%               |
| 5               | 20%               |
| 6               | 20%               |
| 7               | 30%               |

* If there are multiple winners in a category, the reward is split equally
* Any **unclaimed funds roll over** into the next lottery round
* A portion of the pool is reserved for the **contract owner**

---

## Roles

### Players

* Buy lottery tickets by submitting 7 numbers
* Pay an entry fee in Ether
* Can participate in multiple rounds

### Contract Owner

* Deploys the contract
* Starts and ends lottery rounds
* Receives the owner’s share of the pool

---

## Core Features

* Secure Ether handling using Solidity best practices
* Validation of user input (number range & length)
* Deterministic prize allocation logic
* Rollover mechanism for leftover funds
* Owner-only administrative functions

---

## Tech Stack

* **Solidity** (Smart Contract)
* **Hardhat** (Development & Testing)
* **Ethers.js** (Contract interaction)
* **Sepolia Testnet** (Deployment)

---

## How to Run the Project

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd web3-lottery-game
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Compile the Contract

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Run Tests

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Deploy to Testnet

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

## Security Considerations

* This contract is for **learning purposes only**
* Pseudo-randomness on-chain is **not suitable for production lotteries**
* No external audits have been performed

---

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will understand:

* How to build and deploy smart contracts
* Ether flow and pool-based reward systems
* Solidity control structures (`require`, conditionals, modifiers)
* Basic decentralised game mechanics
