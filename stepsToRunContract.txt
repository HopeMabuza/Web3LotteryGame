# 🎯 Remix Button Step-by-Step Guide for Your Lottery

---

## **Step 0: Prepare Remix**

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Create a new file: `lotteryGame.sol`.
3. Paste your current lottery contract code.
4. Enable **Solidity Compiler**:

   * Version: `0.8.20` → click **Compile** → ensure no errors.

---

## **Step 1: Deploy the Contract**

| Action      | What to do                              | Example Value                              |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Environment | Select in **Deploy & Run Transactions** | `Injected Web3` (MetaMask on Sepolia)      |
| Contract    | Select from dropdown                    | `lotteryGame`                              |
| Constructor | Input your Chainlink subscription ID    | `1234` (replace with your subscription ID) |
| Deploy      | Click button                            | Confirm in MetaMask                        |

✅ After deployment, your contract appears under **Deployed Contracts**. This is your **main contract address**.

---

## **Step 2: Buy a Ticket**

| Action          | Button / Field                | Example Value           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Expand contract | Click deployed contract arrow | –                       |
| Function        | Select `buyTicket`            | –                       |
| Input numbers   | 7 numbers array               | `[5,12,23,34,41,45,49]` |
| Value (ETH)     | Set in Remix value field      | `0.000000000000000001`  |
| Transact        | Click **transact**            | Confirm in MetaMask     |

> ✅ First ticket starts the round.

---

## **Step 3: Wait for Round to End**

* Wait **5 minutes** (ROUND_DURATION).
* No button press — the contract tracks time automatically.

---

## **Step 4: Draw Winner**

| Action   | Button / Field      | Notes                   |
| -------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Function | Select `drawWinner` | Only **owner** can call |
| Transact | Click **transact**  | Confirm in MetaMask     |

> This requests **random numbers from Chainlink VRF** and emits `RequestSent`.

---

## **Step 5: Wait for Chainlink VRF Callback**

* VRF automatically calls **`fulfillRandomWords`**.
* Actions triggered:

  * `winningNumbers` are set
  * `pendingRewards` calculated
  * `tickets` cleared
  * Round closed

> ⏳ Wait a few seconds for VRF fulfillment.

---

## **Step 6: Claim Rewards**

| Action   | Button / Field       | Example             |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Function | Select `claimReward` | –                   |
| Transact | Click **transact**   | Confirm in MetaMask |

> Players who matched ≥2 numbers receive ETH. Event `RewardClaimed` emitted.

---

## **Step 7: Start Next Round**

* Players can call **`buyTicket`** again.
* The contract automatically starts a new round when the first ticket is bought.

---

### ✅ Tips

1. Always use **MetaMask gas fee estimation**.
2. Do not send ETH manually — always use `buyTicket()`.
3. Monitor **Events** in Remix → Terminal → Logs:

   * `TicketPurchased`
   * `RequestSent`
   * `WinningNumbersGenerated`
   * `RewardClaimed`
